## Exercise 1.6

Alyssa P. Hacker doesn’t see why `if` needs to be provided as a special form. “Why can’t I just define it as an ordinary procedure in terms of `cond`?” she asks. Alyssa’s friend Eva Lu Ator claims this can indeed be done, and she defines a new version of `if`: 

```scheme
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
         (else else-clause)))
```

Eva demonstrates the program for Alyssa:

```scheme
(new-if (= 2 3) 0 5)
5
(new-if (= 1 1) 0 5)
0
```

Delighted, Alyssa uses `new-if` to rewrite the square-root program:

```scheme
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```
What happens when Alyssa attempts to use this to compute square roots? Explain.

## Solution

In Lisp, functions are evaluated in applicative order. Therefore evaluation of `sqrt-iter` will lead to infinity recursion. However, Haskell uses lazy evaluation. Thus this function will work correct.
